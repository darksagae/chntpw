# chntpw
`chntpw` is a utility in Kali Linux used for resetting Windows passwords and enabling accounts. It works by manipulating the Windows registry files where user account information is stored. Hereâ€™s a guide on how to use it, along with examples and expected outcomes.

### Installation

`chntpw` is usually pre-installed in Kali Linux. You can verify its presence by typing:

```bash
chntpw
```

If it's not installed, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install chntpw
```

### Using chntpw

1. **Prepare the Windows System**:
   - Boot the Windows system into a recovery environment or use a live Kali Linux USB if you're working on a non-bootable system.

2. **Mount the Windows Partition**:
   - Identify the partition where Windows is installed. You can use `fdisk -l` to find it (commonly `/dev/sda1`).
   - Mount the Windows partition:

   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
   ```

3. **Locate the SAM File**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the SAM file:

   ```bash
   cd /mnt/Windows/System32/config
   ```

4. **Run chntpw**:
   - Use `chntpw` to reset the password. The basic command is:

   ```bash
   sudo chntpw -i SAM
   ```

   This command opens an interactive menu for managing user accounts.

### Example Commands

1. **Reset a User Password**:
   - After running `chntpw -i SAM`, select the user account you wish to reset. Follow the prompts to clear the password.

2. **Enable a Disabled Account**:
   - In the interactive menu, you can choose to enable an account that has been disabled.

3. **Remove an Existing Password**:
   - Select the option to clear the password for a specific user.

### Expected Outcomes

- **Resetting Password**: The password for the specified user account will be cleared, allowing you to log in without a password.
  
- **Enabling Accounts**: If you enable a disabled account, you can log in to that account after rebooting.

- **No Data Loss**: Using `chntpw` does not delete user data; it only modifies the password settings.

### Conclusion

`chntpw` is a powerful tool for managing Windows user accounts, particularly in situations where you cannot access the system due to forgotten passwords. Always ensure that you have proper authorization to modify user accounts on any system you are working on.
